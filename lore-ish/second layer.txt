the voice soon realises that controlling you causes no change to what he wants and that he'll be stuck here forever. he soon is filled with spite and decides to trap the player within the sim. The bosses and ememies soon start to act weird on second and third playthrough, soon the sim becomes desolate and the voice becomes the final boss.
the voice was was a developer overlooked in the company that developed the simulation. He was made to volunteer as a test subject in a test that failed.
