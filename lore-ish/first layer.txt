the simulation has been corrupted by a separate force that has realised the potential of the sim, and the creater had then shut it down. the voice that tells you to do tasks, is the perpetrator. he cannot do anything in the sim and needs you to fix stuff, which he is happy that you are caught in this sim. you are his key to solve all his problems. the robots and bosses you fight along the way all try to stop you from causing more harm. All the hints will be dropped after a few levels. 
the vioce is a person who got trapped years ago in the sim and slowly realised the potential of taking control of a world that is not real. the simulation going online will destroy nations.
